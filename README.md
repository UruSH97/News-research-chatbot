# NewsBot â€“ AI-Powered News Research Tool

**NewsBot** is an AI-powered research assistant that allows users to input up to 3 news article URLs and ask questions based on the content from those articles. The system fetches, splits, embeds, and indexes article content using OpenAI and LangChain, enabling real-time Q&A with accurate source attribution.

## Problem Statement
In an age of information overload, keeping up with news while maintaining fact accuracy is challenging. This project aims to simplify that by building an intelligent assistant that extracts news from provided URLs and allows users to interact with the content meaningfully through question-answering.
